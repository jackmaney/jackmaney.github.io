<h2>Open-source Software</h2>

<div class="well">
<h3><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Hypatia">Hypatia</a></h3>

<p>Hypatia is a data visualization API, acting as a "layer of glue" between <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBI">DBI</a> and various data visualization front-end modules.</p>

<div class="well">
<h3><a href="https://github.com/jackmaney/ucc">Universal Correlation Coefficient</a></h3>

<p>At the 2011 Joint Statistical Meetings, <a href="http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2011/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=303386">a paper was presented</a> that introduced the idea of a Universal Correlation Coefficient. This coefficient measures the degree of dependency (but not the form of dependency) for two discrete random variables.</p>

<p>I have written an R library that implements this Universal Correlation Coefficient. This coefficient can be used to automate the discovery of (potentially non-linear) relationships among pairs of discrete random variables.</p>

<div class="well">
<h3><a href="https://github.com/jackmaney/Diophantus">Diophantus</a></h3>

<p>Diophantus, a pet project created to teach myself Java, originated as Mathematica code that I wrote as a graduate student. The original code generated examples and helped form conjectures for what became a series of two peer-reviewed mathematical publications.</p>
