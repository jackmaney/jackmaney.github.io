FIXER-UPPER WARS

EPISODE I: A NEW START

A mid-life crisis! After failed employment negotiations with [the Shadow Broker](https://www.nsa.gov), exiled Jedi Knight Manja Sk'cro<sup><a href="#note1">1</a><a name="note1_return"></a></sup> finds himself without a job and without a sense of self.

With a [nest egg of credits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401%28k%29), he takes transport to a [new planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri) and finds refuge in a home bought cheap due to [galactic turmoil caused by the Trade Federation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_housing_bubble).

Thinking himself bright and confident, our hero sends word throughout the HoloNet that he's available for work and gets a book on home repair.

And that's when the roof starts leaking...

(\*PAN DOWN TO MANJA SK'CRO GRUMBLING AND MOVING BUCKETS TO CATCH DRIPS\*)

"It will be okay. I may not be comfortable walking around on a roof, but I can get a new job doing [mercenary work](http://www.siam.org/reports/mii/1996/index.php) and I'll be able to save up enough to patch the roof."

(\*MONTAGE PASSES BY OF SENDING OUT HUNDREDS OF JOB APPLICATIONS AND HEARING NOTHING BACK\*)

"Well, even grunt work will be better than nothing. \*sigh\* I've got a bad feeling about this..."

(\*MONTAGE OF OUR HERO APPLYING FOR WORSE AND WORSE JOBS, ONLY TO BE TURNED AWAY\*)

(\*MONTAGE ENDS AS OUR HERO'S PHONE RINGS\*)

Manja Sk'cro: "Hello?"

Voice: "Yes, this is Allada Ky-knomi of the [Coruscant Accountants Academy](http://www.hrblock.com/). We can offer you a job where you answer communication calls from angry bureaucrats."

Manja: \*long sigh\* "How much does it pay?"

Allada: "Two credits every other week."

(\*PAN OUT AND CUE THE SAD MUSICAL SCORE FROM THE END OF THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK AS OUR HERO NODS AND SAYS YES TO THE CRAPPY JOB\*)

(\*FADE OUT TO "TO BE CONTINUED"\*)
