Personal:

* Why the hell do I have such a difficult time accepting food from others?

* Logging extra-curricular coding tidbits

* Logging exercise

* More episodes of Fixer-Upper Wars

Mathy Things:

* Start blathering about stuff. Get the brain working again.

* Maybe talk about factorization a bit?

* Talk more about UCC, try to figure out variance of absolute value of successive rank sets.

Coding things:

* `csv-to-table`

* Talk about traps that I fall into (eg the equivalent of `def foo(a=[])`).

* Start building something in Haskell and journal some tidbits along the way.
