So, here we go again...for reasons I don't fully understand, my old site broke. I think part of it was due to upgrades in [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Poet](http://jsantell.github.io/poet/). However, I had grown disillusioned enough with Node.js that I just...well, I gave up.

I was sick of so-called ["Callback Hell"](http://callbackhell.com/), and [promises](http://howtonode.org/promises) really didn't make my code any easier to understand, debug, or maintain.

So, since it's almost a new year, I'm somewhat settled into [my latest job](http://dstsystems.com/solutions/applied-analytics.html), and my mind is somewhat back together again, I thought I'd try a different approach to building my site, and a different hosting solution. Hence GitHub Pages.
